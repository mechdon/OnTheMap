On the Map App

This is the third project for Udacity's iOS Nanodegree course. This is an iPhone app which allows you to retrieve the locations of Udacity students on the map where they are reported to be studying. Upon tapping a pin, the students' URL will be shown. On tapping the URL link, you'll be directed to the website. The user will be able to post their own data by posting a string that can be reverse geocoded to a location and a URL.
